## Today

- cont. working on the DataGrid test
  - 2/6 test are failing using Cypress version 3.3.1
  - 6/6 passed using latest version of Cypress
  - Had to rewrite test with key events
  - using 3.3.1 give an issue on click
    - had to call `click` twice
    - when cypress version is updated there will be an issue on click events for example, DataGrid collapsible if you click on a collapsible cell twice it will open and close
