## Prettier

`Prettier` scans your files for style issues and automatically reformats your code to ensure consistent rules are being followed for indentation, spacing, semicolons, single quotes vs double quotes, etc.

## ESLint

`ESLint` performs automated scans of your JavaScript files for common syntax and style errors.

## Pros

- They keep everybody on the same page, following the same rules.
- They save time in code reviews, because we can safely ignore all style issues, and focus on things that actually matter, like the structure and semantics of our code.
- They catch errors. Prettier, not so much, but ESLint actually catches a lot of syntax errors and simple forms of type errors, such as undefined variables.
- Setting these things up is a one time cost, but the time-saving benefits compound over time.
