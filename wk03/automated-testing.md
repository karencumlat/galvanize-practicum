```

The `react-testing-library` is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of `react-dom` and `react-dom/test-utils`, in a way that encourages better testing practices. It's primary guiding principle is:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

### What this library is not

1. A test runner or framework
2. Specific to a testing framework (though we recommend Jest as our preference, the library works with any framework, and even in codesandbox!)
