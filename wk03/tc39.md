# TC39 Process

[The TC39 Process](https://tc39.es/process-document/)

## Development

Changes to the language are developed by way of a process which provides guidelines for evolving an addition from an idea to a fully specified feature, complete with acceptance tests and multiple implementations. There are five stages: a strawperson stage, and 4 “maturity” stages. The TC39 committee must approve acceptance for each stage.

|     | Stage       | Purpose                                                                               |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Strawperson | Allow input into the specification                                                    |
| 1   | Proposal    | - Make the case for the addition                                                      |
|     |             | - Describe the shape of a solution                                                    |
|     |             | - Identify potential challenges                                                       |
| 2   | Draft       | Precisely describe the syntax and semantics using formal spec language                |
| 3   | Candidate   | Indicate that further refinement will require feedback from implementations and users |
| 4   | Finished    | Indicate that the addition is ready for inclusion in the formal ECMAScript standard   |
