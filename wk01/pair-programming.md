## Definition

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair).

* **Driver** is the he programmer at the keyboard
* **Navigator** the other is involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction

### Pros

* Reduces Towers of Knowledge
  * Towers of Knowledge or Top Performers know the entire codebase. The team lean on them.
  * The towers' partner will be able to relay information to the rest of the team when the tower calls in sick or worst decides to leave the company.
* Makes onboarding awesome
  * New-hires have a constant role model to work under. They will learn about the codebase quickly, and start producing value for the company much faster.
* Produce more than twice the code than individuals
  * Majority of the time developer's spend  at the keyboard is debugging. Having two programmers at one workstation means that teams are twice as likely to know how to fix a problem as soon as they encounter it. It also means they are more responsible about asking for help.

### Cons

* Can complicate simple task
  * A simple bug fix to implement can be expensive to put two programmers on that task. It can be hard for two programmers to stay interested on a task that takes minimal thought-processing power.
* Doesn’t Totally Eliminate Towers of Knowledge
* Holds Employees Super Accountable, Sometimes Over-Accountable
  * It’s impossible to slack off when you have a pair programming partner. Having a teammate that’s watching you all day, keeps you super accountable.
